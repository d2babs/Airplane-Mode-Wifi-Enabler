		<b>FAQ</b>\n
		\n
		<b>I cannot change my Wi-Fi settings while in Airplane Mode.</b>\n
		<b>A:</b> The settings interface automatically "disables" wi-fi configuration in airplane mode. To alleviate this problem you can A) Connect to the wireless connection before going into Airplane mode. B) Install AnyCut and create a "Wi-Fi Settings" shortcut, that will let you change the configuration while in airplane mode.\n
		\n

		\n
		<b>Can I uninstall this Application after changing the configuration?</b>\n
